üó∫Ô∏è Competition Maps
This directory contains the maps used during the RoboCup Junior Egypt Rescue Simulation Maze competition. These maps are designed to challenge robot behaviors such as navigation, hazard detection, and victim identification.

Each map is optimized for testing different aspects of the robot's capabilities. They can be directly loaded into Webots for simulation or customized for other scenarios.

üìÇ Important Note:
To use these maps with the Erebus framework, copy the .wbt map files into the worlds folder in your Erebus setup. This will allow Erebus to recognize the maps during simulations.
